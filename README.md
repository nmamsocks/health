# Overview

To learn the R language I decided to play around with analyzing a health dataset to learn methods of linear regression.

It was fun seeing what the R language could do and I see why its used for large data set problems.


# Development Environment

I used the R language for this project because of its abilities to manage data.

The libraries I used were: 
- ggplot2
- dplyr

# Future Work

- Have it print out a plot that makes sence (attempted)
- Add more statistics
